# Product Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning â€“ Python

## Description

This project aims to predict the demand for products by category for the future. While the actual implementation predicts demand for a real company, the demonstration here utilizes publicly available online retail data to showcase the project's functionality, techniques, and tools used.

The project employs machine learning algorithms to forecast demand based on historical sales data. It serves as a valuable tool for inventory management, production planning, and resource allocation.

## Usage
To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the data:

Ensure that you have the necessary historical sales data in a compatible format. For demonstration purposes, you can use the provided online retail dataset.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository (demand_forecasting.ipynb). Follow the step-by-step instructions to load the data, preprocess it, train machine learning models, and make predictions.

3. Evaluate the Results:

Analyze the model's performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess the accuracy of demand predictions.

4. Adjust Parameters and Experiment:

Feel free to experiment with different machine learning algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature engineering techniques to optimize the prediction accuracy.

## Features
- Predicts demand for product categories based on historical sales data.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for forecasting.
- Provides insights for inventory management, production planning, and resource allocation.
